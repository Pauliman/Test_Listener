# Test_Listener
As with many other features Dialog boxes in Android can be written quick and dirty or according to certain recommendations.
This is just an attempt to do it the way developers.android.com suggested it for testing reasons. 
If you're interested, the code is fully commented and should explain itself.
Don't ask me why I called this Test_Listener. :-)
